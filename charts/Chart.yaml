# The `appVersion` is not a required field whereas `version` is required. If
# you’re making changes to a helm chart template file and/or the default values
# file, you must increment the `version`.

# If you just make a change to an env-specific values file, you do not change
# the `version` field.

# So, if nothing changes about the helm chart itself, and you just need to
# deploy a new container image tagged with a new version number, the only thing
# you’d edit is the env-specific values file that identifies the new tag for
# the image you want to deploy.

# It is optional to increment the `appVersion` field in chart.yml - it is
# helpful to stay consistent, but not required.

# See prod-oralhistory-values.yaml for the env-specific values
